# NodeJS Programming

## Overview
This module helped build strong foundational and advanced concepts of Node.js and JavaScript, focusing on both runtime behavior and language mechanics. Topics were reinforced through real-world coding practices and algorithmic problem solving.

## Topics Covered

### Main Topics

- **NodeJS Runtime**
  - Understood how Node.js executes code outside the browser.
  - Explored CommonJS modules and asynchronous nature of Node.

- **NPM (Node Package Manager)**
  - Learned to initialize, install, and manage packages.
  - Handled dev and production dependencies.

- **OOP in JavaScript**
  - Created classes and objects using ES6+ syntax.
  - Implemented inheritance and encapsulation in Node.

- **Event Loop and Event Handlers**
  - Explored how the Node.js event loop manages async operations.
  - Used event-driven programming with `EventEmitter`.

- **Type Conversions & "use strict"**
  - Practiced implicit vs explicit type casting.
  - Enforced strict mode for better coding practices.

- **Comparisons & Conditional Branching**
  - Worked with equality types and logical branching using `if`, `switch`.

- **User Interaction Methods**
  - Practiced with browser-based interaction functions to understand differences.

- **Logical and Nullish Coalescing Operators**
  - Applied `||` and `??` to set fallback values safely.

- **Recursion and Stack**
  - Solved recursive problems and understood call stack depth and performance.

- **Rest Parameters and Spread Syntax**
  - Used `...` to handle dynamic arguments and merge/clone arrays and objects.

- **Variable Scope & Closures**
  - Differentiated between global, block, and function scopes.
  - Created closures for data encapsulation and callback handling.

### Sub-Topics

- **IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)**
  - Used to isolate scope and avoid polluting global variables.

- **NFE (Named Function Expression)**
  - Explored named expressions for better debugging and recursion.

- **The `new Function()` Syntax**
  - Learned dynamic function creation (used carefully due to security concerns).

- **Scheduling: `setTimeout`, `setInterval`**
  - Managed task timing and learned delays in execution.

- **Decorators and Forwarding**
  - Implemented basic decorators to extend function behavior.

- **call / apply / bind**
  - Mastered how to explicitly set function context (`this`) and reuse logic.

## Practice

- Solved functional and logical problems using Node.js.
- Applied concepts to write clean, efficient, and modular code.
- Practiced real-world scenarios like timers, callbacks, and closures using Node.
